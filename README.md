# Machine_Learning_Project
Emotion recognition through EEG analysis using ML algorithms

In this project we are studying brainwave data from a Kaggle project (EEG brainwave dataset: mental state | Kaggle) and used machine learning models to achieve accurate classification of human emotions based on the brain signals captured through Muse EEG headband. The purpose of this work is to find out whether Kbest or MI, as filter methods, are helping to improve the classification models' performances. 
This project is divided in 3 stages:
 1) Exploratory Data Analysis
 2) Pre-Processing
 3) Applying Models
 
 I have added the project link for your refernece.
